### The Podcast
The McCord brothers have spent almost 20 years building products, technology teams and companies throughout the DMV.  This has allowed them to form a unique network of product and technology talent, perspectives on how products should be built, views on how teams should run and opinions on how the product and technology function fits in an organization.  Add this to the brothers inclusive personalities, they have always been able to create an inviting environment to create and learn.



They plan on using these aspects to advance a platform approach to building the DMV product and technology community.  Today's technology community is accustomed to consuming content on their terms.  The Modular CTO will use this to their advantage by using Podcasts, Blogs and Social Media to cultivate an active community with the DMV.  The inclusive nature of the brothers will present voices from all throughout the community to highlight different ways to think about creating, building and collaborating.
